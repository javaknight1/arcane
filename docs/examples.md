## Customization Examples

### Adding Custom Fields

After import, you can enhance the Notion database:

1. **Add custom properties:**
   - Assignee (Person)
   - Due Date (Date)
   - Effort Points (Number)
   - Labels (Multi-select)

2. **Create custom views:**
   - By Assignee
   - By Due Date
   - By Status and Priority
   - Burndown tracking

### Integration with Other Tools

**Notion API Usage:**
```python
# Example: Sync with GitHub issues
import requests

def sync_with_github(database_id, github_repo):
    # Fetch issues from GitHub
    issues = requests.get(f"https://api.github.com/repos/{github_repo}/issues")

    # Update Notion items based on GitHub status
    for issue in issues.json():
        # Update corresponding Notion page
        pass
```

**Automation Ideas:**
- Slack notifications for status changes
- Google Calendar integration for milestones
- Jira synchronization for enterprise teams
- Email reports for stakeholders

## Best Practices from Examples

### 1. Detailed Project Descriptions

**Good Example:**
```txt
Project: Real Estate Platform

Target Users: Real estate agents, property managers, home buyers
Key Features: Property listings, virtual tours, mortgage calculator
Technical Stack: React frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database
Integrations: MLS data feeds, payment processing, mapping services
Compliance: Fair Housing Act, data privacy regulations
```

**Poor Example:**
```txt
Project: Real Estate Website

A website for real estate.
```

### 2. Appropriate Complexity Selection

Match complexity to your actual needs:
- **Simple**: Basic CRUD operations, minimal integrations
- **Moderate**: Some APIs, moderate data processing
- **Complex**: Microservices, real-time features, ML/AI

### 3. Realistic Timeline Planning

Consider these factors:
- Team experience with technologies
- External dependencies and integrations
- Testing and quality assurance time
- Buffer for unexpected challenges

### 4. Effective Use of Generated Output

After generation:
1. Review all items for accuracy and completeness
2. Adjust priorities based on business needs
3. Add team-specific details and constraints
4. Set up regular review and update cycles

These examples demonstrate the flexibility and power of the Roadmap Notion tool across different project types, team sizes, and industries.
