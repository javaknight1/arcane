# üí° Idea File Guide: Crafting the Perfect Project Brief

## Overview

The idea file is the foundation of your roadmap generation. The more detailed and structured your idea, the more accurate, actionable, and valuable your roadmap will be. This guide helps you create an idea file that maximizes Arcane's AI capabilities.

## üéØ Roadmap Scope: Technical vs. Comprehensive

By default, Arcane generates **technical-focused roadmaps** covering implementation, architecture, and development. However, you can expand your roadmap to include **non-technical aspects** for a holistic project plan:

### Available Non-Technical Aspects:
- **Business Strategy & Planning**: Market research, competitive analysis, business model validation
- **Marketing & Sales**: Brand development, customer acquisition, sales funnel optimization
- **Legal & Compliance**: Terms of service, privacy policies, regulatory compliance
- **Operations**: Process design, workflow automation, vendor management
- **Customer Support**: Help desk setup, documentation, support workflows
- **Finance & Accounting**: Financial systems, revenue tracking, budgeting
- **HR & Team Building**: Hiring plans, onboarding, performance management
- **Product Management**: User research, feature prioritization, analytics
- **Quality Assurance**: QA processes, testing frameworks, quality metrics
- **Risk Management**: Risk assessment, business continuity, crisis management

üí° **Pro Tip**: Use `--roadmap-aspects` flag to include these aspects, or let the interactive mode guide you through the selection.

## The Mindset: Think Like a Project Manager

When writing your idea file, adopt the mindset of a project manager presenting a comprehensive brief to a development team. You want to provide enough context and detail that someone with no prior knowledge could understand:

- **What** you're building
- **Why** it's needed
- **Who** will use it
- **How** it should work
- **When** you need it delivered
- **What constraints** exist

## Bare Minimum Requirements

Your idea file **must** include these essential elements:

### 1. Project Overview (Required)
- **Project name** and brief description
- **Primary purpose** - what problem does this solve?
- **Target audience** - who will use this?
- **Core functionality** - what are the main features?

### 2. Technical Context (Required)
- **Platform/technology preferences** (web, mobile, desktop, etc.)
- **Integration requirements** (APIs, databases, third-party services)
- **Performance expectations** (user load, response times, etc.)
- **Security considerations** (data sensitivity, compliance needs)

### 3. Scope Boundaries (Required)
- **What's included** in this project
- **What's explicitly excluded** (future phases)
- **Success criteria** - how do you measure completion?

### 4. Constraints (Required)
- **Timeline expectations** (launch date, milestones)
- **Budget considerations** (if relevant to technical decisions)
- **Resource limitations** (team size, skill sets available)
- **Technical constraints** (existing systems, legacy requirements)

## üìã Roadmap Scope Considerations

### If Including Non-Technical Aspects
When you plan to include non-technical aspects in your roadmap (business, marketing, legal, etc.), provide additional context in your idea file:

**For Business Strategy & Marketing:**
- Target market analysis and customer personas
- Competitive landscape and differentiation
- Business model and revenue strategy
- Go-to-market approach and marketing channels

**For Legal & Compliance:**
- Industry regulations and compliance requirements
- Data privacy and security considerations
- Intellectual property and legal entity needs

**For Operations & Support:**
- Business process requirements
- Customer service approach and SLAs
- Vendor and partner relationships
- Operational scalability needs

**For HR & Finance:**
- Team scaling plans and organizational structure
- Financial projections and funding status
- Compensation and equity considerations

## Optimal Information Structure

## Advanced Tips for Maximum Impact

### 1. Use Specific Examples
Instead of: "User management system"
Write: "User registration with email verification, role-based access control (admin, editor, viewer), and OAuth integration with Google/Microsoft for enterprise users"

### 2. Include User Stories
```
As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit].

Example:
As a project manager, I want to assign tasks with due dates and priority levels so that I can track team workload and ensure deadlines are met.
```

### 3. Define Success Metrics
```
## Success Criteria
- User adoption: 100 active users within 3 months
- Performance: 95% of pages load under 2 seconds
- Reliability: 99.5% uptime
- User satisfaction: 4.5+ star rating in feedback
```

### 4. Address Edge Cases
Think about unusual scenarios:
- What happens when systems are down?
- How do you handle high traffic spikes?
- What if integrations fail?
- How do you manage data corruption/loss?

### 5. Provide Context and Rationale
Don't just list features‚Äîexplain why they're important:
- Business justification
- User research insights
- Competitive advantages
- Technical reasoning

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Being too vague**: "Build a social media app"
‚úÖ **Being specific**: "Build a professional networking platform for remote workers with video chat integration and skill-based matching"

‚ùå **Technology-first thinking**: "Use React and Node.js to build something"
‚úÖ **Problem-first thinking**: "Solve inventory management pain points, considering React/Node.js if they fit the requirements"

‚ùå **Missing constraints**: Ignoring timeline, budget, or technical limitations
‚úÖ **Realistic boundaries**: Acknowledging what's possible within your constraints

‚ùå **Feature laundry list**: 50 features with no prioritization
‚úÖ **Prioritized features**: Clear must-have vs nice-to-have distinctions
