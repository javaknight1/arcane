## üí° Pro Tips for Success

### Be Specific
- Use concrete examples instead of abstract concepts
- Provide actual numbers (users, revenue, performance)
- Reference similar products or companies when helpful

### Think in Layers
- **Core functionality first**: What's the minimum viable product?
- **Enhancement layers**: What can be added incrementally?
- **Scale considerations**: How will this grow over time?

### Consider the Ecosystem
- **Integrations**: What tools do your users already use?
- **Data flow**: How does information move through your system?
- **User context**: Where and when will people use this?

### Validate Assumptions
- **User research**: Have you talked to potential users?
- **Market research**: Do you understand the competitive landscape?
- **Technical feasibility**: Are there any technical blockers?

## üéØ Roadmap Generation Quality

The quality of your roadmap depends on:

1. **Clarity of vision**: How well you understand what you're building
2. **Detail level**: Enough specifics for the LLM to generate realistic tasks
3. **Context provided**: Business, technical, and user context
4. **Constraints outlined**: What limitations should the roadmap respect
5. **Success criteria**: Clear goals to work backwards from

Remember: The LLM can only work with the information you provide. The more thoughtful and detailed your idea description, the more useful and actionable your generated roadmap will be.
