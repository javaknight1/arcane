When developing an app or starting a new company, you want to create a roadmap. Once you create that roadmap, you will want to import that into a project management software. But that process can be time consuming. I want to create an app that will automate and streamline this process. I've already created a python script that will create an interactive CLI for this. You can find it https://github.com/javaknight1/arcane.git. The overview says teh following:

**Ready to generate your first roadmap?**
```bash
python -m roadmap_notion generate
```

I want a fullstack version of this CLI tool. The website should give users the ability to log into their account, and view the roadmaps they've generated. Please include any other features you think would be relevant. The CLI tool only integrates with Notion, but we would want to integrate with as many other popular project management softwares. We've eventually want to introduce a way to generate revenue. My thinking is that, when a user generates a roadmap, it would only show the first epic of the first story of the first milestone. The rest would be blurred out. It wouldn't have the ability to export to csv or into any project management software. Not sure if we want to do a subscription or a one-time payment. I feel like doing a one-time payment would make more sense since the user wouldn't be using this service that often. Feel free to propose subscription models that would make sense for the end user.

After a user logs into their account, they should be able to create new roadmaps. When they create a new roadmap, they should be prompted with important questions about their roadmap. These prompt should help build the idea prompt message that would be given to the LLM eventually. The roadmap wizard should ask all the relevant and super important questions to help build the BEST prompt to give LLMs to build your idea. My thinking is that if we just ask the user to fill in a textbox, they would only give 2-3 sentences, which should not be good enough. We will want to give the LLM as much data as possible to get the best roadmap result the first time. We don't want the user to keep having to tweak their idea and have to keep asking the LLM for a new roadmap. That will be really expensive for the user and use a lot of credits. 

During any part of the roadmap generation process, the user should be able to download any portion of it: prompts that we generated, outputs from LLMs, generated csv or jsons, etc. Each roadmap that user starts, they should be able to see a historical record. Meaning, let's say they generate a roadmap from an idea, and then generates another one. They should be able to view the previous outputs from previous history.

For the frontend, I don't have a huge opinion, but I do have some opinions. There should be a overall Landing page. The Landing page should be simple and be graphics heavy and really market our product. Take into considering a normal tech startup landing page and make it look as similar to that. Then, the user should be able to login and signup with the login and signup page. Both should include a their own page and include a login with google button. When on their account page, there should be a + New Roadmap button and then a list of existing roadmaps. When you click on the roadmap, it will show that roadmap page. When you click on the new Roadmap button, the user will be redirected to a new page that would be an interactive wizard to help help the prompt that we would be teh idea. The user should be given as many prompts and questions that would help build the best prompt to give to the LLM. The user account page should also have a settings page that should include all the settings needed to configure an account. If there are other pages you think are important, feel free to add them.

When we are building the idea prompt, we need to ask the as many questions to help build the best prompt to get the most accurate roadmap output. What type of tasks do we want? Only technical? Design? Marketing? Business related? etc. How long do we want the roadmap? How many users are going to be working within the roadmap? Include as many questions to give to the user that will be used to make the ultimate prompt to for your app idea.

We also need a path to profitablility. Create different paths to get money. 

We also need to have a method to creating marketing, branding (including logos and other things), and how to gain an audience. We need to include everything to setup our app and company including tasks and items that aren't technical. We need to make sure we have everything needed to setup, deploy, and maintain a full stack application from every aspect. 

There should be the following pages: Landing page, login/signup pages, account page, New Roadmap page/wizard, settings page, and probably all the legal pages. The overall theme should be purple or medium-shade of purple. 

The account page should have a list of all the roadmaps created and then a settings icon in the top right. When they click on the settings icon, it takes them to the settings page. The settings page should have configuration settings like LLM API tokens and Notion or other project management software. The ladning page should be setup and look like we are a new tech startup. It should be full of animations and color marketing. 

I have an existing CLI tool at https://github.com/javaknight1/arcane for an example. It will generate a full roadmap and import into Notion as a project management. 

The name of the app should be called ArcaneAI.

Feel free to expand with features that would be useful or relevant for the user.
