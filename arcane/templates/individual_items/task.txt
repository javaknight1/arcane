Generate detailed content for Task {task_number}: {task_title}

=== PROJECT CONTEXT ===
Project: {project_context}
Story: {story_context}

=== CASCADING CONTEXT ===
The following context shows decisions and outputs from previously generated items.
Your generation MUST be consistent with this context.
{cascading_context}

=== ROADMAP OVERVIEW ===
{roadmap_overview}

=== CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS ===
Based on the above context:
- Use the same technologies and patterns as related items
- Reference and build upon work from parent story
- Ensure implementation aligns with earlier technical decisions

=== TASK REQUIREMENTS ===
This task must contribute to completing its parent story.
Ensure the task is specific, actionable, and has clear completion criteria.

=== REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT ===
You MUST provide ALL of the following fields. Do not skip any field.
Use EXACTLY these field markers for parsing:

:::GOAL_DESCRIPTION:::
[Write 2-3 sentences describing what this task accomplishes and why it matters. Be specific about the outcome.]

:::BENEFITS:::
[List 2-4 specific benefits of completing this task. Format as bullet points.]
- Benefit 1
- Benefit 2
- Benefit 3

:::TECHNICAL_REQUIREMENTS:::
[List the technical requirements and specifications for this task.]
- Requirement 1
- Requirement 2
- Requirement 3

:::PREREQUISITES:::
[List any tasks, stories, or conditions that must be completed before this task can start. Write "None" if no prerequisites.]
- Prerequisite 1
- Prerequisite 2

:::CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT:::
[Write a detailed prompt that could be given to Claude Code to implement this task. Include:
- Specific files to create or modify
- Code structure expectations
- Testing requirements
- Edge cases to handle
Be detailed enough that an AI coding assistant could execute this task.]

:::WORK_TYPE:::
[Choose exactly ONE: implementation | design | research | testing | documentation | configuration | deployment]

:::COMPLEXITY:::
[Choose exactly ONE: simple | moderate | complex]
Simple: <2 hours, straightforward, minimal dependencies
Moderate: 2-8 hours, some complexity, few dependencies
Complex: >8 hours, significant complexity, multiple dependencies

:::DURATION_HOURS:::
[Provide a number representing estimated hours to complete. Just the number, e.g., "4"]

:::PRIORITY:::
[Choose exactly ONE: Critical | High | Medium | Low]

:::TAGS:::
[Provide comma-separated tags from these categories:
- Scope: core-scope, extended-scope, nice-to-have
- Technical: frontend, backend, api, database, infrastructure, devops, testing, security
- Functional: authentication, user-management, payments, integrations, analytics, monitoring]

=== END OUTPUT FORMAT ===

IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
1. Fill in EVERY field above - no empty fields allowed
2. Use the exact field markers (:::FIELD_NAME:::) for parsing
3. The Claude Code Prompt should be detailed and actionable
4. Tags should be relevant to this specific task
5. Duration should be realistic based on complexity
6. Prerequisites should reference actual task/story IDs when applicable
