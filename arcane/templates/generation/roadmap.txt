- **Goal/Description**: [Clear description of what needs to be accomplished]
- **Benefits**: [Business and technical benefits]
- **Prerequisites**: [What needs to be done first]
- **Technical Requirements**: [Technical specifications and constraints]
- **Work Type**: [Type of work: implementation, design, research, documentation, deployment, maintenance, configuration]

##### Task 1.0.1.2: [Another Task Name]
[Same format as above]

#### Story 1.0.2: [Another Story Name]
[Same format as above with tasks]

### Epic 1.1: [Another Epic Name]
[Same format as above with stories and tasks]

## Milestone 2: [Next Milestone Name]
[Same format as above]
```

### Content Guidelines:

{content_guidelines}

{scaling_guidance}

### Tagging Guidelines:
Every story and task MUST include relevant tags to help categorize and filter roadmap items:

**Scope Tags (REQUIRED)**:
- "core-scope": Items directly mentioned in the original idea
- "extended-scope": Supporting items necessary for complete implementation
- "out-of-scope": Creative additions or enhancements beyond the original idea

**Technical Area Tags**:
- "frontend", "backend", "api", "database", "infrastructure", "devops", "testing", "security", "performance"

**Functional Area Tags**:
- "authentication", "user-management", "payments", "integrations", "analytics", "monitoring", "notifications"

**Examples**:
- Authentication story: Work Type="implementation", Complexity="moderate", Tags="core-scope, backend, authentication, security"
- CI/CD setup task: Work Type="configuration", Complexity="moderate", Tags="extended-scope, devops, infrastructure"
- Advanced analytics dashboard: Work Type="implementation", Complexity="complex", Tags="out-of-scope, frontend, analytics"

Note: Priority is handled by the existing Priority field, Work Type has its own field, and Complexity has its own field. Tags should focus on scope and technical/functional areas only.

### Non-Technical Aspects Integration:
When non-technical aspects are included in {roadmap_aspects}, integrate them throughout the roadmap as follows:

- **Business Strategy**: Include epics for market research, competitive analysis, business model validation, pricing strategy, partnerships, and go-to-market planning
- **Marketing & Sales**: Include epics for brand development, content marketing, lead generation systems, sales funnel optimization, customer acquisition campaigns, and conversion tracking
- **Legal & Compliance**: Include epics for terms of service, privacy policy, regulatory compliance implementation, intellectual property protection, and legal entity setup
- **Operations**: Include epics for business process design, workflow automation, vendor management, supply chain setup, customer service processes, and operational metrics
- **Customer Support**: Include epics for help desk setup, documentation systems, training materials, support workflow design, and customer feedback loops
- **Finance & Accounting**: Include epics for financial systems setup, revenue tracking, expense management, budgeting processes, and financial reporting
- **HR & Team Building**: Include epics for team hiring plans, onboarding processes, performance management systems, compensation frameworks, and team culture development
- **Product Management**: Include epics for user research, product strategy, feature prioritization, roadmap planning, user feedback systems, and product analytics
- **Quality Assurance**: Include epics for QA process design, testing frameworks, quality metrics, bug tracking systems, and release management
- **Risk Management**: Include epics for risk assessment, business continuity planning, security audits, insurance planning, and crisis management procedures

Mix these non-technical epics with technical implementation epics to create a comprehensive project roadmap that addresses all selected aspects.

### Technical Detail Requirements:

1. **Architecture Considerations**: Include database design, API structure, frontend architecture aligned with deployment environment and scaling expectations
2. **Technology Stack**: Suggest appropriate technologies based on complexity, team expertise, budget constraints, and technical challenges
3. **Infrastructure**: Include deployment, monitoring, and scalability considerations that match geographic distribution and scaling patterns
4. **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end testing appropriate for team size and methodology
5. **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection aligned with regulatory requirements
6. **Performance**: Optimization strategies and performance requirements based on success metrics and failure tolerance
7. **Integration Planning**: Account for all specified integrations (payment, communication, business, developer, data)
8. **Compliance Implementation**: Address all regulatory requirements throughout the roadmap
9. **Budget Optimization**: Consider infrastructure and services budget constraints in technology choices
10. **Team Considerations**: Align complexity and learning requirements with team expertise level

### Claude Code Prompts:
Each story and task must include a "Claude Code Prompt" that provides specific, actionable instructions for implementing that piece of functionality using Claude Code. These prompts should:
- Be specific enough to guide implementation based on team expertise level
- Include file structures and naming conventions appropriate for the chosen tech stack
- Specify testing requirements aligned with the development methodology
- Include any necessary configuration or setup steps for the deployment environment
- Consider integration requirements and provide specific guidance for each integration
- Address regulatory and compliance requirements where applicable
- Account for budget constraints when suggesting tools or services
- Include performance considerations based on scaling expectations
- Provide appropriate guidance for the team's distribution model (remote/colocated)
- Consider the success metrics and provide implementation guidance for tracking and analytics

### Industry Best Practices:
- Follow the specified development methodology (agile/kanban/waterfall/adhoc)
- Include proper CI/CD pipeline setup aligned with developer integrations
- Consider mobile-first or responsive design based on industry and target market
- Include proper error handling and logging appropriate for failure tolerance level
- Plan for scalability and maintainability based on scaling expectations
- Include documentation and knowledge transfer appropriate for team distribution
- Implement security measures aligned with regulatory requirements
- Consider industry-specific best practices and standards
- Account for geographic distribution requirements (CDN, data residency, etc.)
- Implement monitoring and analytics aligned with success metrics
- Include cost optimization strategies based on budget constraints
- Plan for integration testing based on the number and complexity of integrations
- Consider team expertise level when planning knowledge transfer and training

### Timeline Considerations:
- Distribute work evenly across the specified timeline accounting for velocity multiplier
- Include buffer time for testing and bug fixes based on failure tolerance
- Consider team ramp-up time based on team expertise level
- Plan for iterative development and feedback cycles aligned with development methodology
- Account for compliance review cycles if regulatory requirements are present
- Consider integration complexity when estimating timeline
- Factor in geographic distribution challenges for team coordination
- Account for learning curve if team expertise is below requirements
- Plan milestone deliveries based on success timeline expectations
- Include time for documentation and knowledge transfer appropriate for team distribution
