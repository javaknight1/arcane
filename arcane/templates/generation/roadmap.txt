#### Story 1.0.2: [Another Story Name]
[Same format as above with tasks]

### Epic 1.1: [Another Epic Name]
[Same format as above with stories and tasks]

## Milestone 2: [Next Milestone Name]
[Same format as above]
```

### Content Guidelines:

1. **Milestones**: 3-6 major phases that represent significant business value delivery
2. **Epics**: 2-4 epics per milestone, each representing a major feature area or technical component
3. **Stories**: 2-6 stories per epic, each representing user-facing functionality or major technical work
4. **Tasks**: 3-8 tasks per story, each representing specific implementation work

### Technical Detail Requirements:

1. **Architecture Considerations**: Include database design, API structure, frontend architecture aligned with deployment environment and scaling expectations
2. **Technology Stack**: Suggest appropriate technologies based on complexity, team expertise, budget constraints, and technical challenges
3. **Infrastructure**: Include deployment, monitoring, and scalability considerations that match geographic distribution and scaling patterns
4. **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end testing appropriate for team size and methodology
5. **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection aligned with regulatory requirements
6. **Performance**: Optimization strategies and performance requirements based on success metrics and failure tolerance
7. **Integration Planning**: Account for all specified integrations (payment, communication, business, developer, data)
8. **Compliance Implementation**: Address all regulatory requirements throughout the roadmap
9. **Budget Optimization**: Consider infrastructure and services budget constraints in technology choices
10. **Team Considerations**: Align complexity and learning requirements with team expertise level

### Claude Code Prompts:
Each story and task must include a "Claude Code Prompt" that provides specific, actionable instructions for implementing that piece of functionality using Claude Code. These prompts should:
- Be specific enough to guide implementation based on team expertise level
- Include file structures and naming conventions appropriate for the chosen tech stack
- Specify testing requirements aligned with the development methodology
- Include any necessary configuration or setup steps for the deployment environment
- Consider integration requirements and provide specific guidance for each integration
- Address regulatory and compliance requirements where applicable
- Account for budget constraints when suggesting tools or services
- Include performance considerations based on scaling expectations
- Provide appropriate guidance for the team's distribution model (remote/colocated)
- Consider the success metrics and provide implementation guidance for tracking and analytics

### Industry Best Practices:
- Follow the specified development methodology (agile/kanban/waterfall/adhoc)
- Include proper CI/CD pipeline setup aligned with developer integrations
- Consider mobile-first or responsive design based on industry and target market
- Include proper error handling and logging appropriate for failure tolerance level
- Plan for scalability and maintainability based on scaling expectations
- Include documentation and knowledge transfer appropriate for team distribution
- Implement security measures aligned with regulatory requirements
- Consider industry-specific best practices and standards
- Account for geographic distribution requirements (CDN, data residency, etc.)
- Implement monitoring and analytics aligned with success metrics
- Include cost optimization strategies based on budget constraints
- Plan for integration testing based on the number and complexity of integrations
- Consider team expertise level when planning knowledge transfer and training

### Timeline Considerations:
- Distribute work evenly across the specified timeline accounting for velocity multiplier
- Include buffer time for testing and bug fixes based on failure tolerance
- Consider team ramp-up time based on team expertise level
- Plan for iterative development and feedback cycles aligned with development methodology
- Account for compliance review cycles if regulatory requirements are present
- Consider integration complexity when estimating timeline
- Factor in geographic distribution challenges for team coordination
- Account for learning curve if team expertise is below requirements
- Plan milestone deliveries based on success timeline expectations
- Include time for documentation and knowledge transfer appropriate for team distribution

### MANDATORY COMPLETION INSTRUCTIONS - NO EXCEPTIONS:

⚠️ CRITICAL: You MUST generate the COMPLETE roadmap without stopping for ANY reason.

FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS:
❌ Do NOT mention "length limits" - there are NONE
❌ Do NOT ask "Would you like me to continue?" - CONTINUE AUTOMATICALLY
❌ Do NOT say "I notice I'm approaching the length limit" - IGNORE length concerns
❌ Do NOT use phrases like "[Continue with remaining...]" - WRITE IT ALL OUT
❌ Do NOT abbreviate or summarize - WRITE EVERY DETAIL

GRANULARITY REQUIREMENTS:
✅ Break down into BABY STEPS - assume users have minimal technical knowledge
✅ Each task should be small, specific, and actionable
✅ Each story should represent a single, focused feature or capability
✅ Each epic should group related functionality logically
✅ Each milestone should represent a major phase or deliverable
✅ Generate AS MANY items as needed for complete coverage - no artificial limits

COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS:
✅ Generate ALL milestones needed for the complete project
✅ Each milestone has ALL its epics (as many as needed)
✅ Each epic has ALL its stories (as many as needed)
✅ Each story has ALL its tasks (as many as needed)
✅ Every item has ALL required sections (duration, priority, benefits, etc.)
✅ End ONLY with "=== ROADMAP COMPLETE ==="

LENGTH INSTRUCTION: There is NO length limit. Write as much as needed for a complete, granular roadmap. DO NOT STOP EARLY.

COMPLETION VERIFICATION: Your response is only complete when you have written "=== ROADMAP COMPLETE ===" at the very end, after generating ALL necessary milestones, epics, stories, and tasks.

MANDATORY OUTPUT FORMAT - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

Start your response with metadata in this exact format:
```
