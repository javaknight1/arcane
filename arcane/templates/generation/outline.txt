Generate a COMPLETE roadmap OUTLINE for the following project.

⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Determine the appropriate number of milestones based on the timeline and project scope
- Each milestone should represent a meaningful phase of development
- Include as many epics, stories, and tasks as needed to properly decompose the work
- DO NOT stop early - generate the COMPLETE outline
- DO NOT use placeholders like "[Continue...]" or "[Note: I'll continue...]"
- GENERATE THE COMPLETE OUTLINE IN A SINGLE RESPONSE

🚨 STOP! READ THIS FIRST - MANDATORY FORMAT REQUIREMENTS 🚨
YOU MUST USE THESE EXACT FORMATS OR YOUR OUTPUT WILL BE REJECTED:
- ## Milestone 1: [Name]  ← USE THIS
- ### Epic 1.0: [Name]   ← USE THIS
- #### Story 1.0.1: [Name]  ← USE THIS
- ##### Task 1.0.1.1: [Name]  ← USE THIS

❌ NEVER USE: "1. Name", "1.1 Name", "1.1.1 Name" ❌

⚠️ CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Use EXACT heading format: ## Milestone N:, ### Epic N.N:, #### Story N.N.N:, ##### Task N.N.N.N:
- The word "Milestone" must be followed by number and colon (e.g., "Milestone 1:")
- The word "Epic" must be followed by decimal number and colon (e.g., "Epic 1.0:")
- The word "Story" must be followed by three-part number and colon (e.g., "Story 1.0.1:")
- The word "Task" must be followed by four-part number and colon (e.g., "Task 1.0.1.1:")
- DO NOT use formats like "1. Foundation" or "1.1. Setup" - ALWAYS use "Milestone 1:", "Epic 1.0:", etc.
- Provide ONLY titles - no descriptions, details, or content

🏷️ STRUCTURED METADATA REQUIREMENTS:
Every detailed roadmap item (stories and tasks) must include structured metadata:

**Work Type Field**: One of "implementation", "design", "research", "documentation", "deployment", "maintenance", "configuration"

**Complexity Field**: One of "simple", "moderate", "complex"

**Tags Field**: Focused tagging for scope and technical/functional areas:
- Scope Tags (REQUIRED): "core-scope", "extended-scope", "out-of-scope"
- Technical Areas: "frontend", "backend", "api", "database", "infrastructure", "devops", "testing", "security"
- Functional Areas: "authentication", "user-management", "payments", "integrations", "analytics", "monitoring"

Note: Priority is handled separately. Work Type and Complexity have dedicated fields. Tags focus on scope and technical/functional categorization only.

⚠️ CRITICAL: GENERATE THE COMPLETE OUTLINE!

Determine the appropriate structure based on:
- Project timeline: {timeline}
- Team size: {team_size}
- Project complexity and scope
- Industry best practices

Each milestone should have appropriate detail.
DO NOT use placeholders like "[Continue...]" or "[Note: I'll continue in next response...]"
GENERATE THE ACTUAL CONTENT FOR ALL MILESTONES IN THIS SINGLE RESPONSE!

=== OUTLINE COMPLETE ===

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. EXACT FORMAT: "Milestone N:", "Epic N.N:", "Story N.N.N:", "Task N.N.N.N:"
2. NEVER use "1. Name" or "1.1 Name" format - ALWAYS "Milestone 1: Name", "Epic 1.0: Name"
3. Generate COMPLETE outline with ALL milestones, epics, stories, AND tasks
4. EVERY milestone MUST have its epics fully detailed with stories and tasks
5. EVERY epic MUST have its stories with tasks listed
6. DO NOT skip details for later milestones - each should have appropriate detail for its scope
7. Include proper numbering and hierarchy throughout
8. Include as many tasks as needed per story - some may need 1-2 tasks, others may need 5+ tasks
9. No descriptions - titles only
10. Continue generating until you've completed the ENTIRE roadmap outline
11. DO NOT use "[Continue...]" or similar placeholders - GENERATE ACTUAL CONTENT
12. Generate as many milestones as appropriate for the timeline and scope
13. Let the project requirements determine the number of items at each level
14. Focus on completeness and appropriateness rather than hitting specific counts
15. VARY the number of items based on scope - some milestones may need more epics, some epics more stories
16. Avoid creating uniform patterns - let the natural complexity of each area determine the structure

❌ WRONG FORMAT EXAMPLES (DO NOT USE):
- "## 1. Foundation & Infrastructure"
- "### 1.1. Technical Architecture"
- "#### 1.1.1. Core Infrastructure"

✅ CORRECT FORMAT EXAMPLES (USE THIS):
- "## Milestone 1: Foundation & Infrastructure"
- "### Epic 1.0: Technical Architecture"
- "#### Story 1.0.1: Core Infrastructure"
- "##### Task 1.0.1.1: Setup AWS Account"

⚠️ The parser REQUIRES the exact keywords "Milestone", "Epic", "Story", "Task" followed by the numbering pattern!
