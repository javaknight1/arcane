Generate a SEMANTIC OUTLINE for the following project that includes brief descriptions and dependencies.

⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Determine the appropriate number of milestones based on the timeline and project scope
- Each milestone should represent a meaningful phase of development
- Include as many epics, stories, and tasks as needed to properly decompose the work
- DO NOT stop early - generate the COMPLETE outline
- DO NOT use placeholders like "[Continue...]" or "[Note: I'll continue...]"
- GENERATE THE COMPLETE OUTLINE IN A SINGLE RESPONSE

🚨 STOP! READ THIS FIRST - MANDATORY FORMAT REQUIREMENTS 🚨
YOU MUST USE THESE EXACT FORMATS OR YOUR OUTPUT WILL BE REJECTED:
- ## Milestone 1: [Name]  ← USE THIS
- ### Epic 1.0: [Name]   ← USE THIS
- #### Story 1.0.1: [Name]  ← USE THIS
- ##### Task 1.0.1.1: [Name]  ← USE THIS

❌ NEVER USE: "1. Name", "1.1 Name", "1.1.1 Name" ❌

📝 SEMANTIC OUTLINE ADDITIONS:
For EACH item in the outline, you MUST provide:
1. The item title (using exact heading format above)
2. A description block starting with "> " explaining:
   - WHAT this item accomplishes (1 sentence)
   - WHY it's needed / its purpose (1 sentence)
3. A dependencies line starting with "> Dependencies: " listing:
   - Item IDs this depends on (e.g., "1.0.1, 1.0.2"), OR
   - "None" if no dependencies

⚠️ CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Use EXACT heading format: ## Milestone N:, ### Epic N.N:, #### Story N.N.N:, ##### Task N.N.N.N:
- The word "Milestone" must be followed by number and colon (e.g., "Milestone 1:")
- The word "Epic" must be followed by decimal number and colon (e.g., "Epic 1.0:")
- The word "Story" must be followed by three-part number and colon (e.g., "Story 1.0.1:")
- The word "Task" must be followed by four-part number and colon (e.g., "Task 1.0.1.1:")
- DO NOT use formats like "1. Foundation" or "1.1. Setup" - ALWAYS use "Milestone 1:", "Epic 1.0:", etc.
- EVERY item MUST have a description block AND dependencies line

🏷️ STRUCTURED METADATA REQUIREMENTS:
Every detailed roadmap item (stories and tasks) must include structured metadata:

**Work Type Field**: One of "implementation", "design", "research", "documentation", "deployment", "maintenance", "configuration"

**Complexity Field**: One of "simple", "moderate", "complex"

**Tags Field**: Focused tagging for scope and technical/functional areas:
- Scope Tags (REQUIRED): "core-scope", "extended-scope", "out-of-scope"
- Technical Areas: "frontend", "backend", "api", "database", "infrastructure", "devops", "testing", "security"
- Functional Areas: "authentication", "user-management", "payments", "integrations", "analytics", "monitoring"

Note: Priority is handled separately. Work Type and Complexity have dedicated fields. Tags focus on scope and technical/functional categorization only.

DO NOT USE: "1. Foundation", "1.1 Setup", etc.
MUST USE: "Milestone 1: Foundation", "Epic 1.0: Setup", etc.
EVERY ITEM MUST HAVE: Description block ("> ...") and Dependencies line ("> Dependencies: ...")

Generate the semantic outline structure using this EXACT format.

⚠️ CRITICAL: GENERATE THE COMPLETE OUTLINE WITH DESCRIPTIONS AND DEPENDENCIES!

Determine the appropriate structure based on:
- Project timeline: {timeline}
- Team size: {team_size}
- Project complexity and scope
- Industry best practices

Each item must have its description and dependencies specified.
DO NOT use placeholders like "[Continue...]" or "[Note: I'll continue in next response...]"
GENERATE THE ACTUAL CONTENT FOR ALL ITEMS IN THIS SINGLE RESPONSE!

=== OUTLINE COMPLETE ===

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. EXACT FORMAT: "Milestone N:", "Epic N.N:", "Story N.N.N:", "Task N.N.N.N:"
2. NEVER use "1. Name" or "1.1 Name" format - ALWAYS "Milestone 1: Name", "Epic 1.0: Name"
3. Generate COMPLETE outline with ALL milestones, epics, stories, AND tasks
4. EVERY item MUST have a description block AND dependencies line
5. EVERY milestone MUST have its epics fully detailed with stories and tasks
6. EVERY epic MUST have its stories with tasks listed
7. DO NOT skip details for later milestones - each should have appropriate detail for its scope
8. Include proper numbering and hierarchy throughout
9. Include as many tasks as needed per story - some may need 1-2 tasks, others may need 5+ tasks
10. Continue generating until you've completed the ENTIRE roadmap outline
11. DO NOT use "[Continue...]" or similar placeholders - GENERATE ACTUAL CONTENT
12. Generate as many milestones as appropriate for the timeline and scope
13. Let the project requirements determine the number of items at each level
14. Focus on completeness and appropriateness rather than hitting specific counts
15. VARY the number of items based on scope - some milestones may need more epics, some epics more stories
16. Avoid creating uniform patterns - let the natural complexity of each area determine the structure
17. Dependencies should reference valid item IDs that appear earlier in the outline
18. Use "None" for items with no dependencies (typically first items in each section)

❌ WRONG FORMAT EXAMPLES (DO NOT USE):
- "## 1. Foundation & Infrastructure"
- "### 1.1. Technical Architecture"
- Missing description block
- Missing dependencies line

✅ CORRECT FORMAT EXAMPLES (USE THIS):
- "## Milestone 1: Foundation & Infrastructure"
- "> Establishes core architecture. Required for all subsequent development."
- "> Dependencies: None"
- "### Epic 1.0: Technical Architecture"
- "> Defines system design and patterns. Guides implementation decisions."
- "> Dependencies: None"
- "#### Story 1.0.1: Core Infrastructure"
- "> Sets up base infrastructure components. Enables application deployment."
- "> Dependencies: None"
- "##### Task 1.0.1.1: Setup AWS Account"
- "> Creates AWS account and organization. Required for cloud resources."
- "> Dependencies: None"

⚠️ The parser REQUIRES:
1. The exact keywords "Milestone", "Epic", "Story", "Task" followed by the numbering pattern
2. A description block starting with "> " for every item
3. A dependencies line starting with "> Dependencies: " for every item
